                <p class="text-small">Technology refers to the collection of tools that make it easier to use, create, manage and exchange information. In the earlier times, the use of tools by human beings was for the process of discovery and evolution. Tools remained the same for a long time in the earlier part of the history of mankind but it was also the complex human behaviors and tools of this era that modern language began as believed by many archeologists. Technology refers the knowledge and utilization of tools, techniques and systems in order to serve a bigger purpose like solving problems or making life easier and better. Its significance on humans is tremendous because technology helps them adapt to the environment.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big" id="about">The solution to all your problems is here!</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An information technology (IT) solution is a set of related software programs and/or services that are sold as a single package. IT vendors, service providers and value-added resellers (VARs) market their software suites and service bundles under the label solution to promote the idea that purchasing the product will help the customer successfully solve a problem or deal with a complicated situation.

            Many vendors, software developers, in particular, refer to all of their individual products as software solutions. For example, a vendor may call its antivirus software a solution because it helps to solve a particular problem.
            
            In a stricter sense, however, an IT solution is an aggregation of products and services, as opposed to a single, discrete product. To accurately be called a solution, therefore, the antivirus software should be bundled with related products, such as a spam filter or backup service.
            
            The product versus solution distinction extends back to the 1970s, when VARs emerged. At that time, the rise of microcomputers moved computing beyond the glass house and out to other departments, such as manufacturing and engineering. In response, VARs bundled software -- their own or a third-party package -- with a particular hardware platform and sold the bundle as a turnkey solution designed specifically for a particular use case. Frequently, such hardware/software solutions targeted customers in niche vertical markets.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cybersecurity means protecting data, networks, programs and other information from unauthorized or unattended access, destruction or change. In todayâ€™s world, cybersecurity is very important because of some security threats and cyber-attacks. For data protection, many companies develop software. This software protects the data. Cybersecurity is important because not only it helps to secure information but also our system from virus attack. After the U.S.A. and China, India has the highest number of internet users.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As a backup administrator, your primary job is making and monitoring backups for data protection. A backup is a copy of data of a database that you can use to reconstruct data. A backup can be either a physical backup or a logical backup.

                Physical backups are copies of the physical files used in storing and recovering a database. These files include datafiles, control files, and archived redo logs. Ultimately, every physical backup is a copy of files that store database information to another location, whether on disk or on offline storage media such as tape.
                
                Logical backups contain logical data such as tables and stored procedures. You can use Oracle Data Pump to export logical data to binary files, which you can later import into the database. The Data Pump command-line clients expdp and impdp use the DBMS_DATAPUMP and DBMS_METADATA PL/SQL packages.
                
                Physical backups are the foundation of any sound backup and recovery strategy. Logical backups are a useful supplement to physical backups in many circumstances but are not sufficient protection against data loss without physical backups.
                
                Unless otherwise specified, the term backup as used in the backup and recovery documentation refers to a physical backup. Backing up a database is the act of making a physical backup. The focus in the backup and recovery documentation set is almost exclusively on physical backups.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The arrival of the internet pushed the IT solution industry in new directions. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, managed service providers began to emerge. These companies took advantage of the internet as a cost effective means to remotely oversee their customers' on-premises solutions using lights-out management. This development quickly turned remote monitoring and management into another component of IT solutions.

                    More recently, cloud computing has further expanded IT solution possibilities. Solution providers now offer customers infrastructure as a service, software as a service and other on-demand offerings. The provider either builds and supports its own proprietary cloud services or resells (or recommends) the services of a public cloud provider. </p>
